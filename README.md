# Wheel-Spinner

- This was made for Shivam Sharma as he needed this for using it in his event. 
- It is a simple wheel spinner.
- The wheel has 1-16 numbers marked on it.
- After you click on the spin button the wheel starts rotating.
- This project was created for an event and that event has ended but it's a fun project for beginners to start with!
- So, feel free to contribute and improve this project and that way you can develop your frontend skills as well!
